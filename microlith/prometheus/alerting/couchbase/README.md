All Couchbase specific rules go here. This way they can easily be referenced by others particularly when you want the defaults plus custom rules.

Environment variables can be used within a rule for tuning but must be provided at launch time to substitute - no support for defaulting without.
Alternatively, create an overriding rule and place it in `overrides`.

Do not modify these rules, as your changes may be overwritten when you upgrade.
