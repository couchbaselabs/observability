        title: Could not collect stats from {{ $labels.instance }} (cluster {{ $labels.cluster }})
        description: Statistics collection failed from node {{ $labels.instance }}. Either it is down or its CPU is overloaded.
        remediation: Verify the node's status and examine other metrics and health check results.

        severity: warning
      annotations:
        title: High CPU steal rate on {{ $labels.instance }} (cluster {{ $labels.cluster }})
        description: The percentage of time that the virtual CPU on node {{ $labels.instance }} is waiting for a real CPU is above 3%.
          This can be due to the fact that a virtual Machine is undersized or the hypervisor is overcommited.
        remediation: Increase the resources available to the VM or reduce the number of VMs on the host machine.

        remediation: Review your infrastructure for signs of disk problems or any other issues, or contact Couchbase Technical Support.
