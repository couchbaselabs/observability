=== Stats Collection Failed (CB90038)

*Background*: The CMOS Prometheus server will scrape all Couchbase Server nodes periodically (every 30 seconds by default) for statistics.
If a node fails to respond, this can indicate that the node is down, its CPU is overloaded, or there is a network issue preventing Prometheus from communicating with it.

*Condition*: Prometheus has failed to scrape a Couchbase Server node.

*Remediation*: Check the node's status and resource usage.

=== `memcached` Crashes (CB90036)

*Background*: If the Data Service process (`memcached`) crashes, it will be restarted within a few seconds.
However, repeated crashes should be investigated as they may be caused by an underlying issue.

*Condition*: A crash is seen in the `memcached` logs.

*Remediation*: Contact Couchbase Technical Support.

[#CB90041]
=== CPU Steal (CB90041)

*Background*: Steal time is the percentage of time a virtual CPU waits for a real CPU while the hypervisor is servicing another virtual processor.
In virtual environments, high CPU steal indicates that the virtual machines might be undersized or the hypervisor may be overcommitted.

*Condition*: CPU steal rate is greater than 3%.

*Remediation*: Increase resources available to virtual machine.

[#CB90043]
=== Disk Commit Fail (CB90043)

*Background*: A disk commit failure is when Couchbase Server cannot write data from memory to the file system.

*Condition*: An item failed to be written to disk.

*Remediation*: Review your infrastructure for signs of disk problems or any other issues, or contact Couchbase Technical Support.

[#CB90044]
=== Babysitter Managed Process Crash (CB90044)

*Background*: Babysitter is part of Couchbase Server's cluster manager which is responsible for maintaining a variety of Couchbase Server processes.
If any of the processes managed by the babysitter die, it is responsible for restarting them.

*Condition*: A process managed by babysitter crashes.

*Remediation*: A process can crash for a number of reasons, so if it happens once or twice it is not indicative of a Couchbase Server issue.
However, if it is happening repeatedly or you do notice disruption in your cluster please contact Couchbase Technical Support.

*Further Reading*: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/clusters-and-availability/cluster-manager.html[Cluster Manager]

[#CB90046]
=== Indexer Crash (CB90046)

*Background*: If the Index Service process (`indexer`) crashes, it will be restarted within a few seconds by the cluster manager.
However, repeated crashes should be investigated as they may be caused by an underlying issue.

*Condition*: A crash is seen in `indexer` logs.

*Remediation*: Review `indexer.log` to identify the cause, or contact Couchbase Technical Support.

*Further Reading*: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/services-and-indexes/services/index-service.html[Index Service]

[#CB90048]
=== Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR) Crash (CB90048)

*Background*: If the XDCR process (`goxdcr`) crashes, it will be restarted within a few seconds by the cluster manager.
However, repeated crashes should be investigated as they may be caused by an underlying issue.

*Condition*: A crash is seen in `goxdcr` logs.

*Remediation*: Review `goxdcr.log` to identify the cause, or contact Couchbase Technical Support.

*Further Reading*: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.html[Cross Data Center Replication]

[#CB90049]
=== Full Text Search (FTS) Crash (CB90049)

*Background*: If the FTS Service process (`cbft`) crashes, it will be restarted within a few seconds by the cluster manager.
However, repeated crashes should be investigated as they may be caused by an underlying issue.

*Condition*: A crash is seen in `cbft` logs.

*Remediation*: Review `fts.log` to identify the cause, or contact Couchbase Technical Support.

*Further Reading*: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/services-and-indexes/services/search-service.html[Search Service]

[#CB90050]
=== Eventing Crash (CB90050)

*Background*: If the Eventing Service process crashes, it will be restarted within a few seconds by the cluster manager.
However, repeated crashes should be investigated as they may be caused by an underlying issue.

*Condition*: A crash is seen in `eventing.log`.

*Remediation*: Review `eventing.log` to identify the cause, or contact Couchbase Technical Support.

*Further Reading*: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/services-and-indexes/services/eventing-service.html[Eventing Service]

[#CB90051]
=== Analytics Crash (CB90051)

*Background*: If the Analytics Service process (`cbas`) crashes, it will be restarted within a few seconds by the cluster manager.
However, repeated crashes should be investigated as they may be caused by an underlying issue.

*Condition*: A crash is seen in `cbas` logs.

*Remediation*: Review `analytics_debug.log` to identify the cause, or contact Couchbase Technical Support.

[#CB90033]
=== Long DCP Names (CB90033)

*Background*: All Database Change Protocol (DCP) streams, including internal replication streams, have an internal name.
Before Couchbase Server 7.0, this was implicitly limited to 255 characters (or fewer in some cases), and DCP names that exceed this threshold could result in rebalance failures and other issues.
As of Couchbase Server 7.0, these names are explicitly limited to 200 characters.
This means that an online upgrade to 7.0 could fail if names longer than 200 but shorter than 255 characters are present.

*Condition*: DCP stream names longer than 200 characters are present, or errors related to them are seen.

*Remediation*: Contact Couchbase Technical Support for analysis.

*Further Reading*: https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34280[MB-34280]

[#CB90037]
=== Slow Operations (CB90037)

*Background*: Data Service operations that take longer than 500ms will be logged.
Seeing one or two should not always be cause for concern, but consistent numbers of slow operations may indicate resource contention on your Data Service nodes.
Note that this is different to slow operations logged by the Couchbase SDKs - this health check is purely server-side.

*Condition*: Slow operations logged by the Data Service.

*Remediation*: Verify that your Data Service nodes have adequate system resources.

[#CB90052]
=== Malformed vBuckets (CB90052)

*Background*: Files stored in a Bucket have become corrupted.

*Condition*: vBucket found containing corrupted data.

*Remediation*: Review your infrastructure for signs of disk problems or any other issues. 
Or, navigate to your Data storage directory and enter the following command, making sure to fill in the correct data: `/opt/couchbase/bin/couch_dbck --verbose --json <couchbase_server_data_directory>/<bucket>/<malformed_vb_file>`, then take the response and provide it to Couchbase Technical Support."
