[#CB90038]
=== Stats Collection Failed (CB90038)

*Background*: The CMOS Prometheus server will scrape all Couchbase Server nodes periodically (every 30 seconds by default) for statistics.
If a node fails to respond, this can indicate that the node is down, its CPU is overloaded, or there is a network issue preventing Prometheus from communicating with it.

*Condition*: Prometheus has failed to scrape a Couchbase Server node.

*Remediation*: Check the node's status and resource usage.

[#CB90073]
=== Dropped DCP Mutations (CB90073)

*Background*: This can be an indication of a Couchbase Server Issue (MB-41255) which was fixed in versions: 6.0.5, 6.5.2 and 6.6.1.
This issue can affect data integrity.
DCP mutations track any documents made to Couchbase Server and do Documents. 
If you drop DCP mutations, then changes to documents may be lost.

*Condition*: Dropped DCP mutations found in memcached.log.

*Remediation*: If you experience data integrity issues, update to a more recent version of Couchbase Server.

[#CB90036]
=== `memcached` Crashes (CB90036)

*Background*: If the Data Service process (`memcached`) crashes, it will be restarted within a few seconds.
However, repeated crashes should be investigated as they may be caused by an underlying issue.

*Condition*: A crash is seen in the `memcached` logs.

*Remediation*: Contact Couchbase Technical Support.

[#CB90041]
=== CPU Steal (CB90041)

*Background*: Steal time is the percentage of time a virtual CPU waits for a real CPU while the hypervisor is servicing another virtual processor.
In virtual environments, high CPU steal indicates that the virtual machines might be undersized or the hypervisor may be overcommitted.

*Condition*: CPU steal rate is greater than 3%.

*Remediation*: Increase resources available to virtual machine.

[#CB90043]
=== Disk Commit Fail (CB90043)

*Background*: A disk commit failure is when Couchbase Server cannot write data from memory to the file system.

*Condition*: An item failed to be written to disk.

*Remediation*: Review your infrastructure for signs of disk problems or any other issues, or contact Couchbase Technical Support.

*Further Reading*: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/buckets-memory-and-storage/storage.html[Storage]

[#CB90044]
=== Babysitter Managed Process Crash (CB90044)

*Background*: Babysitter is part of Couchbase Server's cluster manager which is responsible for maintaining a variety of Couchbase Server processes.
If any of the processes managed by the babysitter die, it is responsible for restarting them.

*Condition*: A process managed by babysitter crashes.

*Remediation*: A process can crash for a number of reasons, so if it happens once or twice it is not indicative of a Couchbase Server issue.
However, if it is happening repeatedly or you do notice disruption in your cluster please contact Couchbase Technical Support.

*Further Reading*: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/clusters-and-availability/cluster-manager.html[Cluster Manager]

[#CB90046]
=== Indexer Crash (CB90046)

*Background*: If the Index Service process (`indexer`) crashes, it will be restarted within a few seconds by the cluster manager.
However, repeated crashes should be investigated as they may be caused by an underlying issue.

*Condition*: A crash is seen in `indexer` logs.

*Remediation*: Review `indexer.log` to identify the cause, or contact Couchbase Technical Support.

*Further Reading*: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/services-and-indexes/services/index-service.html[Index Service]

[#CB90048]
=== Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR) Crash (CB90048)

*Background*: If the XDCR process (`goxdcr`) crashes, it will be restarted within a few seconds by the cluster manager.
However, repeated crashes should be investigated as they may be caused by an underlying issue.

*Condition*: A crash is seen in `goxdcr` logs.

*Remediation*: Review `goxdcr.log` to identify the cause, or contact Couchbase Technical Support.

*Further Reading*: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.html[Cross Data Center Replication]

[#CB90049]
=== Full Text Search (FTS) Crash (CB90049)

*Background*: If the FTS Service process (`cbft`) crashes, it will be restarted within a few seconds by the cluster manager.
However, repeated crashes should be investigated as they may be caused by an underlying issue.

*Condition*: A crash is seen in `cbft` logs.

*Remediation*: Review `fts.log` to identify the cause, or contact Couchbase Technical Support.

*Further Reading*: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/services-and-indexes/services/search-service.html[Search Service]

[#CB90050]
=== Eventing Crash (CB90050)

*Background*: If the Eventing Service process crashes, it will be restarted within a few seconds by the cluster manager.
However, repeated crashes should be investigated as they may be caused by an underlying issue.

*Condition*: A crash is seen in `eventing.log`.

*Remediation*: Review `eventing.log` to identify the cause, or contact Couchbase Technical Support.

*Further Reading*: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/services-and-indexes/services/eventing-service.html[Eventing Service]

[#CB90051]
=== Analytics Crash (CB90051)

*Background*: If the Analytics Service process (`cbas`) crashes, it will be restarted within a few seconds by the cluster manager.
However, repeated crashes should be investigated as they may be caused by an underlying issue.

*Condition*: A crash is seen in `cbas` logs.

*Remediation*: Review `analytics_debug.log` to identify the cause, or contact Couchbase Technical Support.

*Further Reading*: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/services-and-indexes/services/analytics-service.html[Analytics Service]

[#CB90056]
=== Memcached Connections Rejected (CB90056)

*Background*: If `memcached` (the Data Service) has too many open connections then it won't allow any new ones to be made.
This will result in client errors on applications attempting to connect to Couchbase Server

*Condition*: The number of open connections to `memcached` reaches its limit.

*Remediation*: Contact your network/application team to see if there are any applications keeping open a large number of connections.

*Further Reading*: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/rest-api/rest-manage-cluster-connections.html[Manage Cluster Connections]

=== Memcached Time Jumps (CB90057)

*Background*: Memcached time jumps occur when the `memcached` process has not been scheduled by the CPU, or not scheduled enough for a significant period of time.
Time jumps are the result of underlying issues (e.g. over provisioning or VM resource contention) with the machine that Couchbase Server is running on, particularly in virtualised environments.

*Condition*: Memcached detected a time jump.

*Remediation*: Check for evidence of your node being over provisioned or for evidence of VM resource contention.

*Further Reading*: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/install/best-practices-vm.html[Virtualisation Best Practices]

=== Dropped Ticks (CB90062)

*Background*: Couchbase Server nodes regularly send heartbeat ticks to each other.
If the Cluster Manager logs `dropped ticks` this means when it tried to process a tick, it found other ticks that had not been processed yet.
In other words, due to a scheduling issue the Cluster Manager was not able to process the previous tick in time.
Dropped ticks are usually a sign of resource contention, specifically CPU contention.

*Condition*: Can be triggered by either detecting over 10 dropped ticks on a node or by detecting over 4 instances of dropped ticks occurring on a node within a one hour time frame.

*Remediation*: Increase number of CPUs available to Couchbase Server or, if you are running a virtualised environment, check for VM overcommitment.

*Further Reading*: xref:7.0@server:install:sizing-general[Sizing Guidelines]

[#CB90067]
=== Service DCP Rollback to Zero (CB90067)

*Background*: A service has been forced to DCP rollback to zero.
A DCP rollback is when the Data Service connects to a client with newer mutations that are not present on the Data Service.
The client must rollback or undo some mutations to align with the mutations on the Data Service.
If the client is rolled back to 0, it means the service is attempting to resynchronize the entirety of the data set.

*Condition*: A DCP rollback to zero is seen in the `memcached` logs in the last hour.

*Remediation*: This is typically a symptom of another problem, you should monitor your cluster closely for any further issues.
If you experience any, then please contact Couchbase Technical Support.

*Further Reading*: https://blog.couchbase.com/couchbase-dcp-rollback-qa-tests/[Couchbase DCP Rollback]

[#CB90070]
=== Permission Denied Errors (CB90070)

*Background*: Couchbase Server has been denied permission to access resources.
This is potentially due to other applications locking Couchbase Server files, or misconfiguration.

*Condition*: Found permission denied errors in memcached.log.

*Remediation*: Check that there are no other applications locking files in your Couchbase Server directory, and that permissions are correctly configured.
If this does not solve the problem, please contact Couchbase Support.

[#CB90072]
=== Data Service Connection Limit (CB90072)

*Background*: By default, the maximum number of connections to the Data Service is limited to 65,000, of which 5,000 are reserved for internal system services.
If this limit is exceeded, clients will fail to connect to your Couchbase cluster.

The default limit is high enough that it is unlikely to be legitimately exceeded in production.
If it is exceeded, the most likely cause is application code failing to shut down connections properly.

*Condition*: Warning if the number of connections is above 80% of the default limit (60,000).
Upgraded to an alert if the limit is exceeded, or log messages are seen that indicate that client connections are being rejected because of the limit.

[NOTE]
====
It is possible to modify this limit.
However, if this is done, you will need to adjust this health check's threshold accordingly, otherwise it may produce false positives or negatives.
====

*Remediation*: Review your application code to ensure that it is closing Couchbase connections properly.

*Further Reading*: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/rest-api/rest-manage-cluster-connections.html[Managing Cluster Connections]

[#CB90033]
=== Long DCP Names (CB90033)

*Background*: All Database Change Protocol (DCP) streams, including internal replication streams, have an internal name.
Before Couchbase Server 7.0, this was implicitly limited to 255 characters (or fewer in some cases), and DCP names that exceed this threshold could result in rebalance failures and other issues.
As of Couchbase Server 7.0, these names are explicitly limited to 200 characters.
This means that an online upgrade to 7.0 could fail if names longer than 200 but shorter than 255 characters are present.

*Condition*: DCP stream names longer than 200 characters are present, or errors related to them are seen.

*Remediation*: Contact Couchbase Technical Support for analysis.

*Further Reading*: https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34280[MB-34280]

[#CB90037]
=== Slow Operations (CB90037)

*Background*: Data Service operations that take longer than 500ms will be logged.
Seeing one or two should not always be cause for concern, but consistent numbers of slow operations may indicate resource contention on your Data Service nodes.
Note that this is different to slow operations logged by the Couchbase SDKs - this health check is purely server-side.

*Condition*: Slow operations logged by the Data Service.

*Remediation*: Verify that your Data Service nodes have adequate system resources.

[#CB90052]
=== Malformed vBuckets (CB90052)

*Background*: Files stored in a Bucket have become corrupted and attempting to read specific parts of those files results in a checksum error. This is normally the result of some issue with the underlying disk / file system / OS - either the data on-disk was corrupted at the time it was written, or the data has subsequently become corrupted and hence it cannot be successfully read.

*Condition*: vBucket detected by Couchbase Server containing corrupted data.

*Remediation*: Review your infrastructure for signs of disk problems or any other issues.
Alternatively, navigate to your Data storage directory and enter the following command, making sure to fill in the correct data: `/opt/couchbase/bin/couch_dbck --verbose --json <couchbase_server_data_directory>/<bucket>/<malformed_vb_file>`, then take the response and provide it to Couchbase Technical Support.

[#CB90055]
=== Metadata Overhead (CB90055)

*Background*: As Couchbase Server stores all of its working documents in memory, if a large portion of that memory is taken up by metadata it can impact performance and force useful documents to be stored on disk rather than memory.

*Condition*: Over 50% of memory is taken up by metadata.

*Remediation*: Increase memory allocation for bucket or change the https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/manage/manage-buckets/edit-bucket.html#making-changes[evictionPolicy] of the bucket from `Value-only` (be aware this will have an adverse effect on performance).

*Further Reading*: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/data/data.html#metadata[Metadata], https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/rest-api/rest-bucket-create.html#evictionpolicy[evictionPolicy].

[#CB90061]
=== Disk Write Queue (CB90061)

*Background*: Having items in the Disk Write Queue for too long could cause applications to backoff and writes to fail.
This usually indicates either a sizing issue, or a storage medium failing.

*Condition*: If the time since the object most recently persisted to disk was added to the Disk Write Queue is over 50 seconds, a warning is produced.
If that time breaches 100 seconds, then a critical alert is produced.

*Remediation*: Review your hardware for malfunctions or sizing issues.
If the problem persists, then please contact Couchbase Technical Support.

*Further Reading*: xref:7.0@server:metrics-reference:data-service-metrics.adoc#kv_ep_storage_age_second[Data Service Metrics], xref:7.0@server:install:sizing-general.adoc#sizing-data-service-nodes[Sizing Data Service Nodes]

[#CB90071]
=== Compaction Failure (CB90071)

*Background*: Auto-Compaction can be set to run either at a specific time, or when fragmentation hits a specific level.
Auto-Compaction requires some free space on disk in order to run, so if there is none available then compaction cannot run.

*Condition*: Auto-Compaction on bucket can fail if there is insufficient disk space available.

*Remediation*: Allocate more storage to existing Data Service nodes, or more Data Service nodes to the cluster, and attempt to rerun Auto-Compaction.
You may also create a new cluster, with more storage, and use unidirectional XDCR to transfer the files over, which should give you the space required for Auto-Compaction.
If that is not possible, please contact Couchbase Technical Support.

*Further Reading*: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/manage/manage-settings/configure-compact-settings.html[Auto-Compaction]

[#CB90087]
=== Active vBuckets Resident Ratio (CB90087)
*Background*: Active vBuckets Resident Ratio going below certain thresholds might lead to performance issues due to significant memory pressure.

*Condition*: Warn if Active vBuckets Resident Ratio drops below 10 percent and alert if the same drops below 5 percent.

*Remediation*: Allocate sufficient memory for the bucket.
