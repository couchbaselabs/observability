[abstract]
It is possible to integrate CMOS with existing monitoring pipelines.
This can be achieved through additional configuration of existing Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana instances.

include::partial$tutorial.adoc[]

== Overview
In this tutorial we will detail the steps needed to configure existing Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana instances to integrate with Couchbase Monitoring and Observability Stack (CMOS).

Depending on which you already have instances for, you may need to consult our xref:tutorial-standalone.adoc[Standalone Installation tutorial], which has independent sections on how to install each component.

Each section within this page is designed to be independent, so only follow the configuration steps required.

== Pre-Requisites
You will need to have Cluster Monitor installed.
If this is not the case, please see our documentation on how to xref:tutorial-standalone.adoc#_install_cluster_monitor[install Cluster Monitor].

== Prometheus

Once you have completed all of the below steps you may need to restart Prometheus to apply the configuration changes.

=== Configuring the Scrape config for your Couchbase cluster

You will need to modify your existing Prometheus configuration file - this is typically named `prometheus.yml`.

See our http://localhost:4040/cmos/0.1/tutorial-standalone.html#_install_prometheus[Install Prometheus] documentation for an example of what this file should look like with an appropriate Couchbase `scrape_config`.

=== Install Prometheus Alerting Rules

Follow the Standalone tutorial instructions on http://localhost:4040/cmos/0.1/tutorial-standalone.html#_prometheus_alerting_rules[Installing Prometheus Alerting rules].

== Alertmanager

=== Downloading and installing Alert templates

Follow the instructions in the http://localhost:4040/cmos/0.1/tutorial-standalone.html#_prometheus_alerting_rules[Standalone example guide].

== Grafana

=== Install all required Grafana plugins
Currently we require:

- https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-json-datasource/[JSON API], which has associated https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-json-datasource/?tab=installation[installation instructions].

Alternatively, if you: 
- Provision Grafana v7.1+ through the use of configuration files, you should https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/#plugins[specify the plugins to install in your configuration file]. 
- Are running Grafana in a Docker container, simply pass through an additional environment variable `GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS=$PLUGIN_NAME $VERSION` where the `$PLUGIN_NAME` and latest `$VERSION` can be found on the plugin's homepage.

=== Download and install CMOS dashboards

The dashboards can be found in the official GitHub repository under https://github.com/couchbaselabs/observability/tree/main/microlith/grafana/provisioning/dashboards[microlith/grafana/provisioning/dashboards]/.

Download them and copy them to a folder accessible by your Grafana installation. You will need to update the `path` argument in your Grafana configuration file - this is typically named `grafana.yml`.
For example:

[source, console]
----
options:
      ...
      # <string, required> path to dashboard files on disk. Required when using the 'file' type
      path: /etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/
      ...
----

=== Configure Grafana Data Sources

Now we have the required plugins and dashboards installed, we need to configure the required Data Sources:

. **Prometheus** - if you're running Grafana, you likely already have a Prometheus instance configured as a datasource. 
If not, the Standalone tutorial has instructions on xref:tutorial-standalone.adoc#_configuring_grafana_datasources[adding a Prometheus Data Source].
. **Cluster Monitor (JSON API)** - click on _Add Data Source_ and select "JSON API". The URL should point to the Cluster Monitor, which listens on port `:7196`, with a sub-path of `/api/v1`. 
Enable `basicAuth`, with the user and password you configured.
. **Alertmanager** - this should follow the same steps as JSON API, except the URL will be `protocol://FQDN:9093/alertmanager/api/v2`, and `basicAuth` may not be required. 

If you are provisioning Grafana as-code, then your `grafana.ini` may look something like this:
[source, console]  
----
...
   - name: JSON API
      type: marcusolsson-json-datasource
      url: http://localhost:7196/api/v1
      basicAuth: true
      basicAuthUser: ${CB_MULTI_ADMIN_USER}
      basicAuthPassword: ${CB_MULTI_ADMIN_PASSWORD}
    - name: Alertmanager API
      type: marcusolsson-json-datasource
      url: http://localhost:9093/alertmanager/api/v2
...
