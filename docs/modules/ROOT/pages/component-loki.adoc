Couchbase cluster generates logs of various operations which is important for monitoring and investigation purposes.
Loki provides the option to parse the logs enabling search and aggregation based on keys.
Logs are pushed to Loki by various tools, we recommend xref:deployment-fluentbit.adoc[Fluent Bit] and provide a method to deploy it.

== Get Started

Loki is managed by the xref:architecture.adoc[Couchbase Monitoring Observability Stack](CMOS).
Loki is enabled by default in the CMOS, however, Fluent Bit needs to be configured for the logs to reach Loki.
Depending upon the type of deployment you need to enable Fluent Bit.
