= Jaeger

[abstract]
Jaeger can be used to collect traces of CMOS components.

== Overview

https://www.jaegertracing.io[Jaeger^] is a distributed tracing system which is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems, distributed transaction monitoring, root cause analysis and service dependency analysis.

In a distributed environment, several independent microservices can be invoked for a single request which need to be examined for performance optimization, dependency analysis and isolating problems.

As part of Couchbase Monitoring and Observability Stack (CMOS), Jaeger comes with configuration to monitor some of the CMOS components.

== Get Started

Jaeger is included and enabled by default in CMOS.
It ships with a default configuration to monitor traces for some of the CMOS components.
Check out the reference xref:architecture.adoc[Couchbase Monitoring Observability Stack](CMOS) architecture to learn more.
Learn more about how to further customize Jaeger https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/deployment/#configuration-options[Configuration Options^].
