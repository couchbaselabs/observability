== Overview

Couchbase Monitoring and Observability Stack (also known as CMOS) is a simple, out-of-the-box solution built using industry standard tooling to observe the state of a Couchbase cluster.
CMOS can be deployed in a VM using Docker or any container runtime.

=== Installation

At this moment, we only support deployment of CMOS using containers.
Use docker to start the CMOS container.
Alternatively, you can also use Linux container tools such as link:https://podman.io[Podman^].
To install CMOS run the command below:

[source,console]
----
docker run --name=cmos --rm -d -P couchbase/observability-stack:latest
----

==== Port Configuration

Couchbase Monitoring and Observability Stack contains multiple services, each running on their own default port such as Grafana(3000), Prometheus(9090), Alert manager(9093), Landing page(8080), Cluster monitor(77196), and Loki(3100).
You can also access different services using path-based routing through the landing page.

=== Verification

You can verify whether the CMOS container is up and running by navigating to the CMOS landing page on port 8080.

To check the port mapping in your host, run the command below:

[source,console]
----
docker container port cmos 8080
----

[console]
----
# output
0.0.0.0:55124
:::55124
----

==== Add Cluster

If you don't have an existing Couchbase cluster setup, you can install it from https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/install/getting-started-docker.html#section_jvt_zvj_42b[here^].
To monitor a Couchbase cluster, you can add it using the add cluster option on the landing page.

As soon as you add a cluster, you will see a Grafana URL where you can view inventory and metrics of Couchbase server clusters.

==== Prometheus

From the landing page, you can go to the prometheus target page and check if the added cluster target is up or down.

==== Grafana

From the landing page, you can go to Grafana and check the graphs.
CMOS comes with pre-installed graphs to monitor the Couchbase cluster.
Graphs with tag `couchbase-7` are relevant for Couchbase server version 7+.
For more information, check the Grafana configuration section.

==== Alerts

CMOS comes with pre-installed alert rules to monitor the Couchbase cluster.
Navigate to Alertmanager, prometheus UI to check the alert rules and alerts.
For more information check the prometheus and alerting configuration section.

==== Loki

Loki, which is shipped with Grafana, allows access to logs of various components.
You can configure it via Configuration > Data sources > Loki > Explore.

From the Log browser, you can enter a custom Loki query or select appropriate labels to see the logs.

After that select the “Show logs” to view logs.
You can also build  https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/getting-started/getting-started/#step-3-create-a-dashboard[custom Grafana dashboards^] based on your needs.
