= Prometheus

[abstract]
The Couchbase Prometheus Server can be used to collect cloud-native metrics from Couchbase Servers.

== Overview

https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus^] is a leading open-source monitoring solution. As a https://www.cncf.io/projects/prometheus/[graduated project^] of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, it has become the industry standard for metrics collection and alert generation on cloud platforms.

Monitoring Couchbase is a critical aspect of production use case. Couchbase exposes detailed metrics that can be collected for visualization and other forms of monitoring. Prometheus fits perfectly as a monitoring solution for these exposed metrics to develop alerts for system issues, identify maintenance windows and other valuable business intelligence insights.
